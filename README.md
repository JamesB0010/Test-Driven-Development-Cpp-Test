# Test Driven Development Cpp Test
 
This is my 1st try at Test Driven Development. I made a VERY SIMPLE stack and was inspired by Uncle Bob! 

Using the microsoft visualstudio CppUnitTestFramework

You can see the TestDrivenStack solution which is the actual project and there is a UnitTest1 Project within the same solution, this is where the tests are

You can press the test tab and then run all tests to see all the tests run in the Unit Test 1 file

And you can press the run button to see the program running
